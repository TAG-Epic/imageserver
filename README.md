# Imageserver - the simple image uploader
## Setting up the server
Note: A nomad job file is also provided. It will load the same variables from `kv/imageserver` but lowercase.  
To set up the server, you have to fill out a few env vars  
`ROOT_KEY` - Security key to prove the images has been uploaded by you. This can be generated by running `python3 -c "import os;print(os.urandom(64).hex())"`  
`ALLOWED_TOKENS` - The user tokens to prove you have access to upload to the server. Comma seperated. This can be generated same way as above.  
`USE_HTTPS` - `true` if the server uses https.  
`URL_PREFIX` - If infront of a proxy, what to prefix the url path with.

## Setting up the client
There should be a few config variables at the top. Change these as follows:  
`IMAGE_SERVER` - The image server to sign at. This should include http/https://  
`SKYNET_PORTAL` - The skynet portal to upload images to.
`LOGIN_TOKEN` - A user token from the server's list of `ALLOWED_TOKENS`

You also have to install `requests clipboard siaskynet notify-py` for the client to work
